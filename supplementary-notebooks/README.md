# Supplementary Notebooks for Downstream Analysis

This notebooks are intended for further processing and highly data dependent.
Therefore, these notebooks are suggestion which need to be adopted quite a bit. 

For more detailed instructions on data clean-up and statistical analysis please refer to the published protocol [Statistical analysis of feature-based molecular networking results from non-targeted metabolomics data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-024-01046-3) by Shah et al. which is available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Functional-Metabolomics-Lab/FBMN-STATS) or as [web application](https://fbmn-statsguide.gnps2.org/).

The `results/FeatureMatrix.tsv` file can be directly used as an input to the protocol. To generate a template for the required meta value table run the `GNPSExport` Notebook and modify the `results/GNPSExport/metadata.tsv` file according to your experimental setup.
